This code is not very pretty. There are several areas of duplicated code that
need refactoring.

This is Proof of Concept quality at best. Do not trust any important keys to
this code.

You have been warned.

The scrypt code is the reference implementation and for that reason has some
major drawbacks. Specifically, the timing information is re-derived on every
encrypt/decrypt call and not cached. This can lead to unexpetedly weak
derivations compared to the host's actual computational power. It can also lead
to decryption operations failing when they should exceed due to the time limit.
The code currently calling scrypt sets excessively long decrypt time limits to
try and avoid this but they may not be adequate in extremely overloaded
environments.

Additionally the calls to scrypt_enc/dec are not pretty or pushed through a
consistant code path and currently have magic numbers re-used all throughout
the code. Sorry.
